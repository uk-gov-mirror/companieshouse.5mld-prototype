      <p class="govuk-body">We have sent a confirmation email to sphillips@myorganisation.org which contains your reference number.
      </p>
      <p>We'll investigate the discrepancy, which could take some time. The company will not be informed that a discrepancy report has been made about their PSC register information.
        </p>
      <p>If we find that the reported discrepancy needs to be corrected, weâ€™ll contact the company and ask that they resolve it to make sure the PSC register is up to date. If the discrepancy is not resolved by the company, we may remove the incorrect information from the register.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We'll email you to let you know the outcome of our investigation.
